# RecommenderSysDemo

This repository holds code for a basic recommender system using the imdb dataset.

The recommender systems built are:
- user based
- item based
- matrix factorization (with L2 regularization)

Also contains some data wrangling techniques.
Wrangle file can be downloaded and run and the data will be generated. Otherwise just download the recommender build file and the data folder and run the recommender build file to see the outputs.
